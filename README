Devel::Command::Tdump implements a debugger command, tdump, to 
automatically load Test::More into the debugger and to selectively capture
portions of the debugger history to build a new Test::More-based test.

If you use Test::More's tests (is(), ok(), etc.) during a debugger session,
tdump can then dump these tests out to a test file (you pick a name) with the
proper test plan already in place.

Like this:

  DB<5> use_ok("MyModule");
ok 1 - use MyModule;

  DB<6> $arg1 = "something";

  DB<7> # set first argument

  DB<8> $arg2 = "yadda yadda";

  DB<9> # Set second argument

  DB<10> $try_it = MyModule->new($arg1, $arg2)

  DB<11> # Create an object

  DB<12> isa_ok($try_it, "MyModule")

  DB<13> tdump "001basic.t"
Recording tests for this session in 001basic.t ... done (2 tests).

  DB<14>
